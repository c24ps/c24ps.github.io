	2.7.21 (my first journal entry) -
	So far we have learned a lot about styling our websites. I have really enjoyed learning how to link other websites, change fonts, colors, format sizing, and more. It has been difficult to problem solve because I obviously do not know everything about coding, so sometimes I do not know what to fix my issues. So far I really like how my website looks, however I do think it needs some more work and so I am excited to see what I will add to it. Programming has been way different from what expected because everything you make is super unique and there are many so different ways to problem solve.

	So far we have learned a lot about styling and now are learning more about variables and functions. I think that I feel generally pretty comfortable with the styling section, however I am still very confused about javascript. When I code along with the videos or with Molly I understand it, but I can not really figure it out myself because I do not yet know enough about the codes.

	An eventListener is something that is constantly tracking, or “listening,” to your website. If one programs it to track clicks, scrolls, mouse movement, and more that it will track that specific action. So then when something else occurs when one clicks, for example, the programming will do it for the coder and know/keep track of the actions on the website.
	- A variable is something that you use to define a portion of your code in the javascript section. It can be equal to something or used to define numbers.
	- A function is the action that you program your variable to do. You have to remember to run the function so that it will actually work. Because if you don’t do this the function is just defined.
	- CSS is the coding language of the style section. It allows you to use code words such as “background color.”
	- HTML is the coding language that we are using in sublime text. You put it at the beginning of sublime text to help you use all of the other keywords. However to do this you can to save your codesketch as “---.html”.
	- To use the console you click inspect on the website and then go to console. You use this tool to track your code and it will check it to see if you have any errors.
	- The terminal is used to push your website online and re-push it online when you update it.
	- Github is what we used to push our websites along with terminal. This is where we get the link for our websites.

	4.11.21 -
	This week we started learning how to create animations. I made a sunset and changed the colors of both the sun and background, while I was making the sun was move downwards. I did this by changing the color of the sun at every set percentage of 6 seconds. I also played around with the opacity of the colors.

	4.18.21 -
	This week we learned how to make arrays. These can result in a certain outcome, but we wanted to randomize them. To do so, we put random in the brakets after the eventlistener, instead of putting a number. The event "listens" to the click, so that when someone clicks a random thing pops up. In my case I made a random dinner generator and put some of my families favorites meals into it. I would be curious to learn how to make multiple variables all randomly generate at the same time. Possibly when running the function I could make all of the variables occur on the same click (however I do not know if one can do that). I had lots of fun making this codesketch and hope to make more like it.
